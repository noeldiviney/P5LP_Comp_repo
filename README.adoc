PSoC_5LP_repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*PSoC_5LP_repo* repository holds the default.xml manifest to allow the
use of Google's "repo" to manage a number of PSoC_5LP CDC Component
Library repositories. +
If you are unfamiliar with repo, you can read up on it
https://code.google.com/archive/p/git-repo/[here].

The *PSoC_5LP Component Library* 
repositories catered for are as follows

https://github.com/noeldiviney/ND_PSoC_Comp_lib  

https://github.com/noeldiviney/ND_PSoC_Sch_Macro_lib  

https://github.com/noeldiviney/Odissey1_lib  

https://github.com/noeldiviney/TDust_UDB_lib  

Credits go to the following contributers who's work I have borrowed on
to create the Library. They have also been a great inspiration in getting
my knowledge up to that required to create the Library. Thanks guys.

1.  Michael Bey .... .. CharLCD I2C lib
2.  odissey1 ... ... .... QuadDecoder, DDS24, DDS32, and KIT-059 
3.  Todd Dust .. ... .. TDust_UDB components

Add other files as required

# Download and Install Google's repo utility

The above libs are managed by the repo utility. First we need to create
our work environment

....
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo 
....

Edit ~/.bash_profile and uncomment lines 32, 33 and 34 to add ~/bin to
PATH

# Create the PSoC_5LP directory

....
$: mkdir -p ~/projects/P5LP/ComponentsDev
$: cd projects/P5LP/ComponentsDev
....

# Initialise the repositories for PSoC_5LP Components

....
$: repo init -u https://github.com/noeldiviney/P5LP_Comp_repo
....

# Download the PSoC_5LP Component Libraries

....
$: repo sync
....

once this has completed you should have PSoC_5LP Component Libraries in
place

** Workspace Name      =  "CompTest"
** Location            =  "Path\To\cygwin64\home\"you"\projects\P5LP\ComponentsTest" 
** Project Name        =  "CompTest"
* and "finish"

When new "CompTest" project is launched

* select Tools->Options
* In "Options" dialog select "Project Management->Default Dependencies"
* Navigate to "Path\To\cygwin64\home\"you"\projects\P5LP\ComponentsDev"
