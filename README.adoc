Add other files as required

# Download and Install Google's repo utility

The above libs are managed by the repo utility. First we need to create
our work environment

....
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo 
....

Edit ~/.bash_profile and uncomment lines 32, 33 and 34 to add ~/bin to
PATH

# Create the PSoC_5LP directory

....
$: mkdir -p ~/projects/P5LP/ComponentsDev
$: cd projects/P5LP/ComponentsDev
....

# Initialise the repositories for PSoC_5LP Components

....
$: repo init -u https://github.com/noeldiviney/P5LP_Comp_repo
....

# Download the PSoC_5LP Component Libraries

....
$: repo sync
....

once this has completed you should have PSoC_5LP Component Libraries in
place
